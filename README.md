# gop seed


this is a program with my learning,
maybe it's not meaningful
but it's just meaningful to me..



 first

     cd ./TxL


 it's a beginning with this script

     ./seed/box/Linux/seed.sh


 then it will make a file named '?'


     sudo ./?


 then try again


     sudo ./?


  ok , just like that... :D
  then, you can see







# sky

the resource and configurations found

they've  grow little bit


# river

all the tools and softwares i used

and forget it

this river is for save the code before as the title

and this is awesome


# tree
